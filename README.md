# Appliances Data Extraction

This repository is part of my thesis for the MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Brescia, Italy.

It contains two notebooks that are used to extract data from the GREEND and UK-DALE datasets:

- `local.ipybn` is the notebook I used to extract most of the data, on my local machine.
- `kaggle.ipybn` is the notebook I used to extract the data of the dish washer in building 5 of GREEND. Due to the size of the data, it could not be run on my local machine, so I used a hack to run NILMTK on Kaggle.
